# Linear-Model-Regression-and-Classification-

A financial institution is launching a stock market trading service for its existing account holders. While the service is costly due to infrastructure, licensing, and personnel expenses, the institution plans to generate profit by charging a commission on trade transactions. However, since this service is also offered by competitors—sometimes at lower commission rates—the institution aims to attract and retain heavy traders by offering discounts. 

The challenge is that offering discounts across the board could reduce profits from customers who don't trade in large volumes. To address this, the institution wants to selectively offer discounts to customers who are likely to be heavy traders (i.e., generate significant revenue). 

To achieve this, they conducted a beta run with around 10,000 customers, manually categorizing them into two revenue categories: 
a. Revenue Category 1: Customers who are profitable (heavy traders) and should receive discounts.
b. Revenue Category 2: Customers who should not receive discounts to maintain profitability.

The goal is to use this data to build a predictive model that can identify whether a customer is likely to fall into Revenue Category 1 and, therefore, be eligible for discounts.

For Regression:

I have created a predictive model using linear regression for loan interest rates, where I applied linear regression to predict interest rates for a peer-to-peer lending platform. Given a test and train dataset containing various details of loan applications, our task was to develop a model that accurately predicts the interest rate offered to applicants based on their inputs.

Key Highlights:

Data Analysis: I started by exploring the training data to understand the factors that influence interest rates. This involved analyzing applicant demographics, credit history, loan purpose, and more.

Feature Selection: Identified key features that impact interest rates was crucial. I focused on variables like loan amount, applicant income, credit score, and employment history.

Model Building: I used linear regression, a fundamental yet powerful statistical method, to build our predictive model. By fitting a linear equation to the observed data, I aimed to capture the relationship between the input features and the interest rates. Additionally, I implemented Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

Model Evaluation: The performance of our model was evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, ensuring it provides reliable predictions.


Classification:

Approach:

Building a Predictive Model Using Classification for Loan Interest Rates.
Given the same test and train dataset of loan applications, including various applicant details, our task was to build a model that can predict the interest rate a peer-to-peer lending platform might offer. This predictive capability can help improve decision-making and offer more personalized loan products.

Approach:
I used classification techniques to build a linear model. By analyzing the relationship between the applicant's details (features) and the interest rate offered (target), we trained the model to understand patterns and make accurate predictions.

Insights Gained:

a. Data preprocessing and feature engineering played a key role in enhancing model accuracy.

b. Regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso helped us avoid overfitting, ensuring that the model performs well on unseen data.

c. The model's predictions can potentially streamline the loan approval process, making it more efficient and fair for applicants.
